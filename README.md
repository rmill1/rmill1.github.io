## HTML + CSS Unit 1 Project: Static Webpage

I built a static webpage in honor of my cat (because I love her too much) and all of her different sleeping spots around my apartment.

The page features several different diary entries that highlight Shasta's go-to napping spots, along with a gallery of several other adorable pictures. 


## HTML + CSS Unit 2 Project: Design Manifesto

This is a design manifesto that includes several tips for good webpage design. 

The page uses a monochromatic color scheme, and is organized with the Bootstrap grid, card components, and a header and footer.


## JavaScript Unit 1 Project: Memory Game

This is a memory game with state shapes - click on the cards to reveal the state and try to make a match.

Currently in full screen the page scrolls unless the inspector is open...a future goal is to ensure there is no scrolling at all so all game elements are seen at the same time


## JavaScript Unit 2 Project: Mini Pokedex

This is a quick reference Pokedex that utilizies the PokeAPI. Trainers can type in a Pokemon's name and get information about that monster's type, abilities, strengths, and weaknesses.

Currently strength and weakness buttons only return a Pokemon's first type strengths and weaknesses (if it has two types)

## JavaScript Unit 3 Project: Tic Tac Toe
This is a one-player or two-player tic tac toe game. Currently the computer takes only random picks. A future modification would be to teach it how to make "smarter" moves when playing against the user.

For the code challenge that was part of the fellowship application, I chose the Python tic tac toe challenge, so it was super interesting to compare my approach to building a tic tac toe game for a second time...because it was very different! (in a good way)
