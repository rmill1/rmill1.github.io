## Unit 1 Project: Shasta's Sleep Diary

I built a static webpage in honor of my cat (because I love her too much) and all of her different sleeping spots around my apartment.

The page features several different diary entries that highlight Shasta's go-to napping spots, along with a gallery of several other adorable pictures. 


## Unit 2 Project: Design Manifesto

This is a design manifesto that includes several tips for good webpage design. 

The page uses a monochromatic color scheme, and is organized with the Bootstrap grid, card components, and a header and footer.
