## HTML + CSS Unit 1 Project: Static Webpage

I built a static webpage in honor of my cat (because I love her too much) and all of her different sleeping spots around my apartment.

The page features several different diary entries that highlight Shasta's go-to napping spots, along with a gallery of several other adorable pictures. 


## HTML + CSS Unit 2 Project: Design Manifesto

This is a design manifesto that includes several tips for good webpage design. 

The page uses a monochromatic color scheme, and is organized with the Bootstrap grid, card components, and a header and footer.


## Javascript Unit 1 Project: Memory Game

This is a memory game with state shapes - click on the cards to reveal the state and try to make a match.

Currently in full screen the page scrolls unless the inspector is open...a future goal is to ensure there is no scrolling at all so all game elements are seen at the same time
