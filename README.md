# Rachel's Portfolio


## Welcome!

This portfolio contains a sample of web dev projects that I have worked on over the course of the last few years. A few projects were ones that I built for the Upperline Codes/Giant Machines teaching fellowship, some are some built in alignment with the freeCodeCamp.org curriculum, and others were neat projects that I built to use in my computer science classroom.


### Random Seating Chart Generator

I built this for my middle school classes and would use it each day to randomly generate a seating chart. Each seat will populate with the student's name, but for obvious reasons, names aren't used here.


### Masterpiece Scoring Calculator

At school I coach FLL Robotics, and for a chunk of the 2023-2024 season, the unofficial scoring calculator wasn't working. So I built my own for my teams to use.


### JavaScript Pokemon Reference

This is a quick reference Pokedex that utilizies the PokeAPI that I built for the then-Upperline Code Teaching Fellowship as part of pre-work. Trainers can type in a Pokemon's name and get information about that monster's type, abilities, strengths, and weaknesses. Currently strength and weakness buttons only return a Pokemon's first type strengths and weaknesses (if it has two types)


### Bootstrap Styling Examples

It took me a while to get used to and get on board with using Bootstrap styling classes, but once I did I thought they were super useful. I built this for a Giant Machines summer course to show students the power of Bootstrap's styling classes. The only non-Bootstrap CSS that I used was for the toggle switches.


### JavaScript Role Playing Game

I built this in conjunction with the freeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures curriculum. I thought it was a neat approach to building this type of game, compared to how I might have conceptualized it had I built my own from scratch.


### CS7 Web Dev Reference

I built this in conjunction with the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design curriculum, and built it with my 7th grade computer science classes in mind as something students would be able to use when working on projects for class. In class we learn about how to use documentation on the internet (like W3Schools, MDN, etc.), but I thought it might be useful to target the handful of most common HTML/CSS concepts we learn in class.
