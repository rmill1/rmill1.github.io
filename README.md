# Upperline HTML + CSS Unit 1 Project

This is my project for Upperline Unit 1 of HTML and CSS!

## Shasta's Sleep Diary

I built a static webpage in honor of my cat (because I love her too much) and all of her different sleeping spots around my apartment.

The page features several different diary entries that highlight Shasta's go-to napping spots, along with a gallery of several other adorable pictures.
